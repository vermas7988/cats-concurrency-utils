# RequestRegistry Library

A Scala library for managing requests and their corresponding responses in a decoupled manner using `cats.effect.Deferred`.

## Overview

The `RequestRegistry` is a utility to manage asynchronous requests and responses. It leverages Cats Effect's `Deferred` to handle responses in a decoupled manner, allowing parts of a program to make requests and other parts to provide responses.

## Features

- Register requests and await responses.
- Complete requests with responses from different parts of the program.
- Built using Cats Effect.

## Usage

### Adding the Dependency

To use the `RequestRegistry` library in your project, you need to add the Cats Effect library to your `build.sbt` file.

## Caution
**Note:** This is not a managed library and rather use it as a code example. You can adapt and integrate this code into your projects as needed.
